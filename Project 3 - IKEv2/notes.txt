Assignment Content

    The IKEv2 protocol defined in RFC 7296 performs authentication and establishes keys for use with 
    IPSec. For this assignment, you are to model and verify the security of the initial set-up of the 
    IKE SA and determine if it is secure. There are several ways that an IKE permits authentication, 
    such as with certificates. You only need to model the basic case where 
    both parties are using certificates. 
    
    You need not model the approaches for protecting against 
    resource exhaustion attacks using cookies. As you are only verifying authentication and the 
    establishment of the initial IKE SA, you need not model the creation of a child SA. 
    (Hint: Your model should only consist of 4 messages.)


    What to turn in:


    Your CPSA model of the IKEv2 protocol authentication. (The text file you used to run your analysis.)

    A Word or PDF document with a discussion of the skeletons you used in your analysis and the 
    assumptions you made and an explanation of what the shapes indicate.

    If you discover an attack, explain how the attack would take place. 


The Authentication payload contains data used for message authentication purposes. The authentication 
method types so far defined are RSA digital signature, shared-key message integrity code, and DSS 
digital signature.
